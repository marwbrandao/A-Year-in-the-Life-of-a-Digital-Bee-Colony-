### Necessary Packages and Versions

This project concerns a simulation of multi-agent system, imitating the interactions of bees in a hive.
In order to properly run the system, it's necessary to install a few packages that build up the environment.

Firstly, we recommend using Python 3.9.0 since other Python versions might not support the packages we used.

Then, you can use pip to install ma-gym and PettingZoo.

    pip install ma-gym

    pip install PettingZoo==1.12.0


Another packages that should be installed are numpy and scipy.
    
    pip install numpy scipy
